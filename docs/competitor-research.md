# toddleSpot — Competitor Research

## The Headline Finding

**Nobody owns "Yelp for parents" in the UK.** There is no established, well-known app that helps parents find and review everyday venues based on specific baby/child-friendly criteria. The market is wide open.

## Closest Competitors: Deep Dive

### TotSpots (totspots.tech) — CLOSEST COMPETITOR
- Community-powered app for family-friendly venues (restaurants, cafes)
- Filters for changing tables, pram space, high chairs, play areas
- Has a rewards/gamification system for reviews
- **BUT:** Very early stage, limited traction, unclear venue database size, basic branding
- **Opportunity:** toddleSpot can execute faster and deeper, especially with hyper-local strategy

### BabyCities (babycities.app) — SIMILAR CONCEPT
- Built on Google Maps, community-driven amenity pictograms
- Changing tables, baby chairs, pram access, playgrounds, meal heating
- **BUT:** Swiss-founded (2023), unfunded, thin UK coverage, no gamification
- **Opportunity:** Global focus = thin everywhere. toddleSpot's hyper-local strategy wins

### NCT BabyChange — NICHE OVERLAP
- Free app from NCT for finding baby changing facilities
- Crowdsourced, colour-coded map pins, cleanliness ratings
- **BUT:** Only covers changing facilities — nothing else
- **Opportunity:** toddleSpot subsumes this entirely with broader scope

### Winnie (US only) — BEST MODEL TO LEARN FROM
- "Yelp for parents" in the US with crowdsourced venue stories/tips
- Specific amenity details (stroller access, nursing areas, changing tables)
- Well-funded ($2.5M+)
- Has pivoted toward childcare marketplace
- **Learning:** Their crowdsourced "Stories" (free-text tips beyond ratings) are excellent. e.g. "the changing table is in the disabled toilet, ask staff for the key"

## Key Gaps toddleSpot Exploits

1. **No dominant UK player** for everyday venue baby-friendliness ratings
2. **Existing apps focus on classes/activities** (Hoop, Happity) not cafes, pubs, parks, restaurants
3. **Google Maps has no baby-friendly filters** — parents read hundreds of general reviews hoping someone mentions a high chair
4. **NCT BabyChange is too narrow** — parents need holistic view, not just changing facilities
5. **Social apps (Peanut, Mush) have community but no venue utility**
6. **No competitor is going hyper-local** — toddleSpot starts deep in one area vs thin everywhere
7. **Accessibility data is poorly captured** — step-free access, pram routes are missing across competitors

## toddleSpot's Positioning

**"The UK's trusted, crowdsourced guide to baby-friendly venues — rated by real parents on what actually matters."**

### Why we win:
1. **Venue-specific, not activity-specific** — we cover everyday outings (cafes, pubs, parks), not just classes
2. **Structured baby-friendliness criteria** — not just stars, but specific ratings on changing facilities, high chairs, pram access, step-free access, parking, breastfeeding, noise, menus
3. **Hyper-local depth** — deepest, most reliable data in one area before expanding (vs competitors spreading thin)
4. **Practical utility first** — solve "where can I go RIGHT NOW with my baby?" not "find mum friends"
5. **Accessibility-first** — step-free access, pram routes benefit parents AND wheelchair users

### Tagline options:
- "Find your next outing. Rated by parents, for parents."
- "Baby-friendly places, reviewed by the parents who go there."
- "Where to go with your little one — rated on what really matters."
